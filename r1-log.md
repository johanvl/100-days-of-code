The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.

## Log

### Day 1:

**Today's Progress:** I started a new course about React w / Hooks and Redux. I changed the search page of my blog to filter posts by the active language.

**Thoughts:** The course about React seems to be pretty complete, has great reviews and I believe it will help me understand better. The search page on my blog is only working in the default language, I could not figure out why. I'll have to get back to this later.

**Link(s) to work:** [Blog commit](https://github.com/kellynvd/kellynvd.github.io/commit/b33ff56db0a68cc0dd3d8c43005db1ea3f42459d)
