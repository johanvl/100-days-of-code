The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.

Started on [June 04, Tuesday, 2019].

## Log

### Day 1:

**Today's Progress:** I started a new course about React w / Hooks and Redux. I changed the search page of my blog to filter posts by the active language.

**Thoughts:** The course about React seems to be pretty complete, has great reviews and I believe it will help me understand better. The search page on my blog is only working in the default language, I could not figure out why. I'll have to get back to this later.

**Link(s) to work:** [Blog commit](https://github.com/kellynvd/kellynvd.github.io/commit/b33ff56db0a68cc0dd3d8c43005db1ea3f42459d)

### Day 2:

**Today's Progress:** Today my main focus was the course about React ⚛️. The course is well structured and every lesson has small challenges to be done. You not only observe the instructor writing code, but you practice on your own several times. Today's section was about setting up Babel, exploring JSX, JSX expressions, conditional rendering in JSX. The starter application will be a decision-making app called Indecision.

**Thoughts:** I'm enjoying React and and I can't wait to start my own projects with it.
