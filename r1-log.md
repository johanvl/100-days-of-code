### :date: Day 1:

**Today's Progress:** I started a new course about React w / Hooks and Redux. I changed the search page of my blog to filter posts by the active language.

**Thoughts:** The course about React seems to be pretty complete, has great reviews and I believe it will help me understand better. The search page on my blog is only working in the default language, I could not figure out why. I'll have to get back to this later.

**Link(s) to work:** [Blog commit](https://github.com/kellynvd/kellynvd.github.io/commit/b33ff56db0a68cc0dd3d8c43005db1ea3f42459d)

### :date: Day 2:

**Today's Progress:** Today my main focus was the course about React ⚛️. The course is well structured and every lesson has small challenges to be done. You not only observe the instructor writing code, but you practice on your own several times. Today's section was about setting up Babel, exploring JSX, JSX expressions, conditional rendering in JSX. The starter application will be a decision-making app called Indecision.

**Thoughts:** I'm enjoying React and and I can't wait to start my own projects with it.

### :date: Day 3:

**Today's Progress:** Today I continue studying #reactjs in Udemy's course and I learn about: ES6 (const, let, arrow functions), events handlers.

**Thoughts:** I started a project using React and got confused with some concepts but today I had one of those moments when everything starts to click, it was an exciting feeling.

### :date: Day 4:

**Today's Progress:** Today I cover the fundamentos of JSX, how it work, how set up event handlers (forms, buttons...) and React components. Tomorow I'm learning more complex React topics.

**Thoughts:** I was not very productive today but I feel that I achieved a lot this week, I'm happy with the results so far.

### :date: Day 5:

**Today's Progress:** Today I learned a little more about React components. Components are the building blocks of any React app and a typical React app will have many of these. With them we have a reuse of larger code and less probability of new bugs appearing in the application.

**Thoughts:** My favorite part about software is that it’s challenging every day.

### :date: Day 6:

**Today's Progress:** I watched some videos of the react course, but I could not make much progress today.

**Thoughts:** For me Sundays are usually quite slow, but Mondays bring a feeling of fresh start. A new day, a new week, new challenges and new opportunities.

### :date: Day 7:

**Today's Progress:** Today was a good day. I was able to finish another section of the #reactjs course and I got through:
  - Nesting components
  - Components props
  - Method Binding
  - Component State

**Thoughts:** So far, so good. Tomorrow the section will be about Stateless Functional Components.

### :date: Day 8:

**Today's Progress:** Today I learned about Stateless Functional Component which is just a plain javascript function which takes props as an argument and returns a react element.

**Thoughts:** A functional component has no state, no lifecycle methods and it’s easy to write unlike a Class Component that has state, lifecycle methods and React creates an instance of a class component every time React renders it. Functional components are usually used to display some UI and class components are used for more complex tasks such as handling some logic, state and events.

I also learned about the Default Props Values, React Dev Tools and Lifecycle Methods. Tomorrow's section will be about Webpack.
